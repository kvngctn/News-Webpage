Between Slack notifications, text messages, emails and doing actual work, my brain sometimes feels like mush when I have to start something new. Whether I'm speaking in a meeting or coming up with new ideas, there are times when I can't rely on myself to get it together fast enough.

That's when I lean on ChatGPT to reset my focus and help me see holes that I may not see otherwise. When I'm stuck on a thought or simply have no ideas at all, I turn to this one prompt in particular — and it boosts my productivity almost every time.

        <h3>The anatomy of the mental wall</h3> <br>

            I’ve spent years using AI as a sounding board, but I recently realized I was using it wrong. I was asking ChatGPT to "help me plan" or "summarize my ideas," which usually resulted in the AI simply agreeing with me. It was a digital echo chamber.
            Now, when I have a new strategy, a pitch or a controversial argument, I don't ask for a "critique." I type one word.
            <b>Potato.</b>
            By assigning a specific, "adversarial" meaning to this word in my Custom Instructions (or at the start of a chat), I’ve turned ChatGPT into a world-class logic checker. Here is how the "Potato" method identifies the gaps in my thinking that I’m too biased to see.

        <h3>The problem: The ‘AI yes-man’ effect</h3> <br>

            ChatGPT is trained to be helpful and harmless. By default, it tends to follow your lead. If you give it a mediocre idea, it will often try to "fix" it or make it sound better rather than telling you it’s fundamentally flawed.
            This is dangerous for productivity. It gives you a false sense of confidence in a weak argument. To get a real critique, you have to give the AI permission to be harsh.
