        <p class="article_text">In Spain, more than 10,300 cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed each year, making it one of the most aggressive forms of cancer. Its detection in the late stages of the disease and the lack of effective therapies mean that the five-year survival rate after diagnosis is less than 10%. But research is finally taking off and starting to change the paradigm after decades of very limited progress.

Mariano Barbacid, head of the Experimental Oncology Group at the National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), has designed a therapy that successfully eliminates pancreatic tumours in mice completely and durably, with no significant side effects. The study is published in the journal PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences), with Carmen Guerra as co-lead author and Vasiliki Liaki and Sara Barrambana as first authors.

“These studies open the road to design novel combination therapies that may improve the survival of PDAC patients [pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma – the most common type of pancreatic cancer],” the authors state in PNAS. “These results set the course for developing new clinical trials.”</p>
