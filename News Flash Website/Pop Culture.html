        <p class="article_text">We were in for a wild ride as Jujutsu Kaisen drew to a close and Gojo was finally unsealed from the prison realm. In JJK chapter 221, Gege Akutami, at last, gave a taste of the much-awaited Gojo vs. Sukuna showdown. The fans went crazy right after this chapter, which reminded me of Michael Scott’s “It’s Happening!” scene in The Office TV show. The battle has finally ended after 15 chapters, and we ourselves have a winner. Keep reading to find out who will ultimately win the fight between the King of Curses and the strongest Jujutsu sorcerer.
<br><br>
Do you remember the first time Gojo was introduced in Jujutsu Kaisen, and he instantly went on to clash against Sukuna (in Yuji’s body)? We have come a long way since then. And finally, we will witness the godly battle between two supreme beings in the Jujutsuverse. On one hand, Gojo is said to be the world’s strongest Jujutsu sorcerer of today. On the other, Sukuna is called the King of Curses and the strongest sorcerer in history. As Tai Lung from Kung Fu Panda says, “Finally! A Worthy Opponent! Our Battle Will Be Legendary!” It is indeed gonna be legendary!
<br><br>
Technically, during the first Gojo vs. Sukuna battle, Sukuna wasn’t at his full power as Yuji had only consumed one of his fingers. That’s not the case anymore, as Sukuna has regained most of his powers. So, everyone is madly waiting to witness this battle, and we are hyped to the core. Gojo was questioned by Itadori in JJK Season 1 Episode 2 (manga chapter 3) about who was stronger between him and Sukuna. Then, Gojo remarked that it might be a little difficult for him to defeat the King of Curses if Sukuna ate all his fingers and regained his full power. So, Itadori, being the simpleton he is, asked Gojo if he would lose, to which he said, “No, I would win.”
<br><br>
In the very same scene, Sukuna expressed that Gojo will be the first person he’ll kill for sure once he makes Itadori’s body his own. To which Gojo funnily replied, “It’s an honor to be targeted by Sukuna.” These exact phrases are repeated in Jujutsu Kaisen chapter 221, and this throwback makes us feel the long journey we have taken to reach here. These two powerful characters in Jujutsu Kaisen have been waiting to beef against each other from the start and it’s about to happen soon.
