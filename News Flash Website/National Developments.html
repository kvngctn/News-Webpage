The Expanded Pambansang Pabahay Para sa Pilipino Program (4PH) of President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. has reached the University of the Philippines Los Baños (UPLB) with the launch of a new rental housing project that will benefit around 800 low-income university employees.

In a Palace press briefing on Friday, Presidential Communications Office (PCO) Undersecretary and Palace Press Officer Claire Castro said Human Settlements and Urban Development Secretary Jose Ramon Aliling and UPLB Chancellor Jose Camacho Jr. launched the Expanded 4PH UPLB Rental Housing Project last Thursday.

Castro said the program marks the end of over 40 years without a housing project for staff in the university.

“Panahon pa ni dating Pangulong Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. noong 1980s ang huling housing project sa UP Los Baños na pinakikinabangan ng mga faculty members ng paaralan,” said Castro.

As the fifth rental housing development under the expanded 4PH Program, the project involves the construction of two five-storey buildings in Paciano Rizal, Bay, Laguna, located across the UP Rural High School campus. Once completed, it is expected to provide affordable rental housing to low-income UPLB personnel and qualified informal settler families.

According to Secretary Aliling, the project is part of the ongoing expansion and acceleration of President Marcos Jr.’s Expanded 4PH program.

Similar housing initiatives are also planned in Quezon City, Victorias City, and Iloilo City in partnership with local governments. | PND
